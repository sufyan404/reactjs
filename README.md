# React Projects Showcase

This repository serves as a collection of various React.js projects and concepts. It's designed to showcase different aspects of React development, including:

- Building common UI components
- Implementing custom hooks
- Managing state with Context API and Redux
- Handling routing
- Working with Tailwind CSS
- And more!

Each sub-directory within this repository likely represents a standalone React application or a specific feature demonstration.

## Projects Included:

Here's a quick overview of the individual projects/modules you can find in this repository:

- **Custom Hooks/currencychanger**: A project demonstrating the creation and use of custom React hooks, specifically for a currency conversion application.
- **Password generator/passwordGenerator**: A utility application to generate secure passwords.
- **bgChanger**: A simple React app to dynamically change the background color of a page.

- **counter**: A basic state management example, demonstrating incrementing/decrementing a counter.
- **customReact**: Potentially a project where React's core concepts are re-implemented or explored.
- **node_modules**: (This directory contains project dependencies and is typically ignored by Git; you usually won't interact with it directly).
- **o1context**, **o2context**, **o3todoContext**: Projects exploring and demonstrating the React Context API for state management, with `o3todoContext` likely being a Todo application built with Context.
- **redux**: A project showcasing state management using the Redux library.

## Getting Started:

To run any of these projects locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/sufyan404/reactjs.git](https://github.com/sufyan404/reactjs.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the repository directory:**
    ```bash
    cd reactjs
    ```
3.  **Navigate into the specific project directory you want to run:**
    (Replace `[PROJECT_FOLDER]` with the actual folder name, e.g., `blogify`, `counter`, `routers`)
    ```bash
    cd [PROJECT_FOLDER]
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies:**
    Each project might have its own `package.json` file.
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR if you prefer yarn
    # yarn install
    ```
5.  **Start the development server:**
    The command to start the server might vary based on the project's `package.json` scripts (`"start"`, `"dev"`, etc.).
    ```bash
    npm start
    # OR
    # npm run dev
    ```
    (Check the `scripts` section in the `package.json` of the specific project for the correct command.)
